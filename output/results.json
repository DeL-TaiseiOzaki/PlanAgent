    "- Plan the structure and functionality of the calculator application.",
    "2. **Subtask 2: Setting Up the Development Environment**",
    "- Set up a Python development environment with the necessary libraries, packages, and tools.",
    "- Create a new project directory for the calculator application.",
    "3. **Subtask 3: Implementing Basic Calculator Functions**",
    "- Implement basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
    "- Test and debug the basic calculator functions.",
    "4. **Subtask 4: User Interface Design and Implementation**",
    "- Design a simple user interface for the calculator application.",

  "refine_agent_result": " Thank you for the instructions. I understand that I am a plan modification agent, and my task is to select one of the SUBTASK OPERATION operations to modify the query plan. Here are the guidelines:\n\n1. I can only modify subtasks with a SUBTASK\\_id larger than 1.1 (exclusive).\n2. If the existing plan is considered good enough, I should use the REFINE\\_SUBMIT operation.\n3. I can perform a maximum of 5 operations before using the REFINE\\_SUBMIT operation, and I should be mindful of the budget.\n4. The maximum depth for all plans is 3. I should be careful when using the SUBTASK\\_SPLIT operation.\n5. I must always use a function call to respond.\n\n--- STATUS ---\nFile system structure: File system structure as a string\nModification node message: Modification node message",
  "dispatch_agent_result": "SYSTEM PROMPT:\n```\nIn this task, you will be creating a simple calculator application using Python. The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user should be able to input two numbers and select the operation they want to perform. The application should then display the result of the calculation.\n```\n\nUSER PROMPT:\n```\nNone provided.\n```\n\nAdditional Content:\n\n* The calculator should handle exceptions and display an error message if the user inputs invalid data, such as non-numeric values or empty inputs.\n* The calculator should allow the user to choose the operation they want to perform by entering a corresponding number (e.g., 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.) or by typing the operation itself (e.g., \"+\" for addition).\n* The calculator should display a clear prompt for the user to enter their numbers and select the operation.\n* The calculator should use functions to perform the different operations, making the code organized and easy to read.\n* The calculator should include comments in the code to explain what each part does.\n* The calculator should have a main function that calls the other functions and controls the flow of the program.\n\nHere is an example of how the code might look like:\n\n```\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Enter the first number:\")\n    num1 = float(input())\n    print(\"Enter the second number:\")\n    num2 = float(input())\n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n    operation = int(input())\n    if operation == 1:\n        result = add(num1, num2)\n    elif operation == 2:\n        result = subtract(num1, num2)\n    elif operation == 3:\n        result = multiply(num1, num2)\n    elif operation == 4:\n        result = divide(num1, num2)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation\")\n    print(f\"The result is {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"
